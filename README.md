Hi, I’m Syed Sikandar Shah, a skilled software engineer with over 3 years of experience. I’ve completed numerous projects at Ford9 Solutions and the National Incubation Center at the University of Swat. I specialize in building dynamic and responsive web applications.


During my tenure at Ford9 Solutions, I developed and managed React applications and created web pages using HTML, CSS, Material UI, and Bootstrap. At NIC, I was a key player in the Touch Tally project, an innovative IoT fingerprint attendance system.

I’m passionate about technology and the startup culture. I’m constantly exploring new tools and technologies to enhance my development skills. Let’s work together to create impactful projects and drive technological progress.
